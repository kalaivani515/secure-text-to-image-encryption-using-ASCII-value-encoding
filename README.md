# secure-text-to-image-encryption-using-ASCII-value-encoding
a text to image technique to do the hiding of text inside the image. 
This method involves the storing the value of ASCII in the image's X, Y coordinate. 
The Ascii value is stored in one of the three Red, Green, or Blue channels, where the other two channels correspond to the message's next coordinate. To generate the random keys , the system involves picking up of the random images of size 256*256.The decryption process involves production of the decrypted text file which has the message.
The system is secure and could be combined with the other encryption standard algorithms to make it even more secure
